Game instructions:
1. Enter a "Play Until" score.
2. Click "new game"
3. Click "Roll Dice"
4. Press "Hold" to end your turn

The object of the game is to get a total score equal to or greater than the "Play Until" score.
You can roll as many times as you wish on each turn.
However, if you roll two 6's in a row you have rolled a 1, you lose your current turn score.
